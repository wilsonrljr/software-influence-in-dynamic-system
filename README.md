This paper presents an analysis of the influence of softwares and operating systems and its respective hardware in the simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems. Furthermore, different mathematical equivalence of polynomial model of the Chua’s circuit were chosen and simulated to highlight the inaccuracy of the results of each form of implementation of the analyzed model. The main results of the paper shows that equivalent mathematical models have different results when simulated in mathematical software, also with distinction when applied on different operating systems.
